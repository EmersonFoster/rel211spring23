        <h3>Matt 1-4; Mark 1; Luke 1-4; John 1-4, 17</h3>
        <p>
          The many things that I got out of this week reading is God is love. He
          loves us and what’s the best for us. He wants us to be with him again.
          John 3: 16 reads: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only
          begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but
          have everlasting life.” This shows the love God as for us that he gave
          to us what matte the most to him. He knew we could not do it alone. On
          the Church website it states: “God loves everyone with an everlasting
          love. He is the father of our spirits. We are His children. He loves
          each one of us individually and wants us to come to know and love
          Him.” I also like what verse 17 says: “For God sent not his Son into
          the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might
          be saved.” Christ was not sent here to condemn but to be a person we
          can relive on. To help us, to talk to and to be a peacemaker in our
          lives. Again, form the church website it states: “God knew that this
          life would be full of challenges and uncertainty. He knew that we
          would fall short and make mistakes. So, He sent His Son, Jesus Christ,
          to earth. Jesus lived a perfect, sinless life. He taught His gospel
          and showed us the right way to live. He willingly gave his own life as
          a sacrifice for our sins. He is our loving Savior and Redeemer.” We
          need to remember that we can’t really do anything that we can’t use
          the Atonement on. Christ knew/knows everything that we will go though
          in this life. He felt it and he bleed for it. He as asks us to come
          unto him because he knows what we will or have been though. When we
          can’t carry it anymore, we can give it to him. This is also from the
          church website: “God loves us immensely. His greatest gift to
          humankind—His Son, Jesus Christ—reflects that love and is central to
          His plan of happiness for all of His children.” I feel that this sums
          up all of the reading for this week. God gave us his son because he
          loves us.
